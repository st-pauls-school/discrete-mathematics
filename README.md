documentation to support the delivery of OCR further maths (Discrete Mathematics module (Y544))[] (p59--)

- have a single book with chapters
- have chapter available as standalone
- need to build the model to allow for that

- restructure to reflect the bullet points from the syllabus.

## Syllabus

### 7.01 Mathematical Preliminaries

### 7.02 Graphs and Networks

Graphs and networks are introduced as mathematical objects that can be used to model real world systems
involving connections and relationships. The pure mathematics of graph theory is studied including
isomorphism, and Eulerian, Hamiltonian and planar graphs.

### 7.03 Algorithms

The algorithmic approach to problem solving in
introduced via sorting and packing problems. The
run-time and order of an algorithm are studied,
including the hierarchy of orders.

### 7.04 Network Algorithms

Problems involving networks are introduced: shortest
path; minimum connector; travelling salesperson and
route inspection.
Standard network algorithms are studied and used to
solve these problems.

### 7.05 Decision Making in Project Management

Networks are applied to decision making, in particular
to activity networks and critical path analysis,
including scheduling.

### 7.06 Graphical Linear Programming

The concept of linear programming is explored as a
tool for optimisation, including integer programming.

Linear programmes are solved graphically.

### 7.07 The Simplex Algorithm

The simplex algorithm is used to solve optimisation
problems.

### 7.08 Game Theory

Problems of conflict and cooperation are explored
using game theory, including both pure and mixed
strategies.
